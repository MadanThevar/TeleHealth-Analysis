## 🗄️ SQL Queries Using PostgreSQL

### Basic Beginner Questions

1. **👨‍⚕️ How many telehealth visits were conducted by gender?**
   - **Main Function Used**: `COUNT(*)`
   ```sql
   SELECT Gender, COUNT(*) AS VisitCount
   FROM TelehealthServicesUsage
   GROUP BY Gender;

2. **🔢 What is the average satisfaction score for each service type?**
   - **Main Function Used**: 'AVG()' and 'ROUND()'
   ```sql
   SELECT ServiceType, ROUND(AVG(SatisfactionScore), 2) AS AverageSatisfaction
   FROM TelehealthServicesUsage
   GROUP BY ServiceType;

3. **💸 What is the total healthcare cost for each type of insurance?**
   - **Main Function Used**: 'SUM()' and 'TO_CHAR()'
   ```sql
   SELECT InsuranceType, TO_CHAR(SUM(HealthcareCost), 'FM$999,999,999.00') AS TotalCost
   FROM TelehealthServicesUsage
   GROUP BY InsuranceType;
