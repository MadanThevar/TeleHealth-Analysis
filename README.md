</div>

## üöÄ Overview and Purpose

The **Tele-Health Data Analytics** project dives deep into the analysis of telehealth services using state-of-the-art tools like Python üêç, PostgreSQL üêò, Power BI üìä, and ERD Builders üõ†Ô∏è. This project is designed to extract actionable insights from telehealth service data, helping healthcare providers optimize service delivery, enhance patient satisfaction, and make informed, data-driven decisions. Through this analysis, we emphasize the critical role of data in transforming healthcare delivery and improving patient outcomes. 

## üîç Key Findings

- **üìà Service Utilization Patterns**: The analysis identifies peak usage times and the most frequently used telehealth services, offering insights into demand patterns.
- **üòä Patient Satisfaction**: We discovered key factors that influence patient satisfaction, providing opportunities for targeted improvements.
- **üí∏ Cost Analysis**: The project offers a detailed breakdown of healthcare costs by service type and insurance coverage, allowing for a deeper understanding of financial trends.
- **üîÑ Follow-Up Trends**: We explored how follow-up requirements impact healthcare costs and patient satisfaction, offering insights into care continuity.
- **üß† Frequent Visits**: Mental health issues were the most common diagnoses leading to frequent telehealth visits, highlighting the importance of accessible mental health services.

## üìÇ About the Dataset

- **üì• Source**: The dataset is sourced from well-known telehealth providers, including Teladoc Health and Amwell, with additional data web-scraped from platforms like SourceTelehealth and RemoteHealth.
- **üìù Content**: The dataset includes fields such as `ServiceType`, `PatientID`, `SatisfactionScore`, `HealthcareCost`, and `FollowUpRequired`.
- **üîê Modification**: To ensure privacy, fictional IDs were created while maintaining the authenticity of the other data fields.
- **üßπ Data Cleaning**: Python was utilized for data cleaning, including the removal of duplicates and ensuring data integrity, to provide reliable insights.

## üóÑÔ∏è ERD Diagram for Tele-Health Data Analytics

### üìù Overview

The **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)** for the Tele-Health Data Analytics project is a visual representation of the key entities involved in telehealth services and their relationships. This ERD was created using **dbdiagram.io** üõ†Ô∏è and serves as the foundation for understanding the structure of the telehealth data.

### üìä Key Entities

1. **üßë‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Patients**: 
   - Contains patient information such as ID, age, gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status.

2. **üè• Visits**: 
   - Records each telehealth visit, including details like patient ID, visit date, service type, visit duration, satisfaction score, technical issues, follow-up needs, healthcare cost, insurance details, and diagnosis.

3. **ü©∫ Diagnoses**: 
   - Logs the primary diagnosis associated with each visit.

4. **üíª Telehealth Platforms**: 
   - Tracks the platforms (e.g., Teladoc, Amwell) used to deliver telehealth services.

5. **üõ°Ô∏è Insurance**: 
   - Captures information about the insurance coverage for telehealth services.

6. **‚öôÔ∏è Technical Issues**: 
   - Logs any technical difficulties encountered during the telehealth visit, including descriptions of the issues.

### üîó Key Relationships

- **üë• Patients ‚Üî Visits**: 
  - Each patient can have multiple visits, with each visit linked to a specific patient.

- **üîÑ Visits ‚Üî Diagnoses**: 
  - Every visit is associated with a primary diagnosis.

- **üíª Visits ‚Üî Telehealth Platforms**: 
  - Each visit takes place on a particular telehealth platform.

- **üõ°Ô∏è Visits ‚Üî Insurance**: 
  - Each visit is covered by a specific type of insurance.

- **‚öôÔ∏è Visits ‚Üî Technical Issues**: 
  - Any technical issues during the visit are recorded and linked to the visit.

### üéØ Purpose of the ERD

The ERD is designed to:
- **üîç Visualize Relationships**: Clearly illustrate the connections between patients, visits, diagnoses, platforms, insurance, and technical issues.
- **üìà Facilitate Data Analysis**: Enable efficient querying and analysis of telehealth data, such as service utilization patterns, patient satisfaction, and platform performance.
- **üöÄ Optimize Data Management**: Assist healthcare providers in managing telehealth data, allowing for improved service delivery and data-driven decision-making.

This diagram is crucial for the project's data management strategy, making it easier for healthcare providers to analyze trends, improve patient outcomes, and optimize telehealth services. The ERD was constructed using **dbdiagram.io** üõ†Ô∏è, a powerful tool for creating and visualizing database structures.
